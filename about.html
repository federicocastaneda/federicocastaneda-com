I work with Front-end technologies within the Drupal CMS. Over the last several years I've worked on nationally recognized brands and successful fundraising efforts for major non-profits.

Though most of my time is spent in the world of Drupal I do venture out often on personal projects (e.g. this site is built on *Jekyll*).
