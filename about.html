<p>I work with Front-end technologies within the Drupal CMS. Over the last several years I've worked on nationally recognized brands and successful fundraising efforts for major non-profits.

<p>Though most of my time is spent in the world of Drupal I do venture out often on personal projects (e.g. this site is built on <em>Jekyll</em>).</p>

<p>To see some of my work just <!-- check my <a target="_self" href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a> or --> click around my site.</p>

<p>If you'd like get in touch send me a <a target="_self" href="/contact">message</a>.</p>
